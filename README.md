# EV_DataWarehouse_Project
This project builds a data warehouse for EV analytics, enabling insights into usage, performance, and key metrics. It follows a constellation schema and uses SQL Server for storage. Raw EV data was cleaned in Python, and ETL pipelines were built to transform and load structured data into the warehouse.
